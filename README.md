This repository is the home to patches created against Peopletools Puppet
modules to correct issues found in our environment.

# File list
    ./README.md

## pt_profile
users.pp is patched to remove the 'chage' command run against psadm2.
We set a real password and do not want this user blocked from any work. In 
particular this will break setting up cron jobs as psadm2.

    ./pt_profile/manifests/pt_system/users.pp.patch

## pt_config
Everything in here is for the CRM Online Marketing DES server setup. If you do
not use CRM Online Marketing you likely will not need any of this.

    ./pt_config/lib/puppet/provider/pt_des_domain/des_domain.rb.patch
    ./pt_config/lib/puppet/provider/webappdomain.rb.patch
    ./pt_config/lib/puppet/type/pt_des_domain.rb.patch

## pt_setup
Currently this only sets the TUXDIR back to the 8.55 version number. If you are
using the 8.55 modules this won't apply to you. I will update this to templatize
that version so that 8.56 and 8.55 can coexist in the puppet codebase.

    ./pt_setup/templates/linux_user_environment.erb.patch

## pt_deploy
These correct minor typos and add functionality for patching middleware during 
the Puppet deploys.

    ./pt_deploy/lib/puppet/provider/pt_deploy_apphome/deploy_apphome.rb.patch
    ./pt_deploy/lib/puppet/provider/pt_deploy_tuxedo/deploy_tuxedo.rb.patch
    ./pt_deploy/lib/puppet/provider/pt_deploy_weblogic/deploy_weblogic.rb.patch
